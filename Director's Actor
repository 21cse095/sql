select actor_id,director_id from ActorDirector group by actor_id,director_id having count(*)>=3;
Problem statement
Table: ActorDirector

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+

Timestamp is the primary key column for this table.


Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor have co-worked with the director at least 3 times.

Example:

ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+

Result table:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+

The only pair is (1, 1) where they co-worked exactly 3 times.

Sure! Let's walk through your SQL query:

```sql
SELECT actor_id, director_id 
FROM ActorDirector 
GROUP BY actor_id, director_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3;
```

---

### üß† **What this query does:**

* It **groups** rows by the combination of `actor_id` and `director_id`.
* Then it **counts** how many times each actor-director pair appears in the table.
* It only **returns** those pairs that occur **3 or more times**.

---

### üóÇÔ∏è **Sample `ActorDirector` Table:**

| actor\_id | director\_id |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 101          |
| 2         | 102          |
| 1         | 101          |
| 3         | 101          |
| 1         | 101          |
| 2         | 102          |
| 2         | 102          |
| 4         | 103          |

---

### üîÑ **Step-by-Step Execution:**

1. **GROUP BY actor\_id, director\_id**

This creates groups like:

| actor\_id | director\_id | Rows in group       |
| --------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| 1         | 101          | \[Row1, Row3, Row5] |
| 2         | 102          | \[Row2, Row6, Row7] |
| 3         | 101          | \[Row4]             |
| 4         | 103          | \[Row8]             |

2. **Apply COUNT(\*) in HAVING clause:**

We only keep those groups where the count is ‚â• 3.

| actor\_id | director\_id | Count |
| --------- | ------------ | ----- |
| 1         | 101          | 3 ‚úÖ   |
| 2         | 102          | 3 ‚úÖ   |
| 3         | 101          | 1 ‚ùå   |
| 4         | 103          | 1 ‚ùå   |

---

### ‚úÖ **Final Output:**

| actor\_id | director\_id |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 101          |
| 2         | 102          |

---

Excellent question! When you use `GROUP BY` with **two or more columns**, SQL will group the data based on **unique combinations** of values in those columns.

---

### üîß **Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, AGGREGATE_FUNCTION(column3)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

---

### ‚úÖ **How it works:**

* SQL forms groups based on **each unique pair** (or tuple) of `column1` and `column2`.
* Then it applies the aggregate function (like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`, etc.) **within each group**.

---

### üìä **Example:**

Let‚Äôs say you have a table `sales_data` like this:

| region | product | sales |
| ------ | ------- | ----- |
| North  | Pen     | 100   |
| North  | Pen     | 200   |
| North  | Book    | 150   |
| South  | Pen     | 300   |
| South  | Book    | 250   |
| South  | Book    | 100   |

---

### üìÑ **Query:**

```sql
SELECT region, product, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region, product;
```

---

### üß† **How GROUP BY (region, product) works:**

It will create groups like:

* (North, Pen) ‚Üí \[100, 200]
* (North, Book) ‚Üí \[150]
* (South, Pen) ‚Üí \[300]
* (South, Book) ‚Üí \[250, 100]

Then `SUM(sales)` is applied **within each group**:

| region | product | total\_sales |
| ------ | ------- | ------------ |
| North  | Pen     | 300          |
| North  | Book    | 150          |
| South  | Pen     | 300          |
| South  | Book    | 350          |
