select p.FirstName,p.LastName,a.City,a.State from Person as p left join Address as a on p.PersonId=a.PersonId;

Problem statement
Table: Person

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| PersonId    | int     |
| FirstName   | varchar |
| LastName    | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
PersonId is the primary key column for this table.
Table: Address

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| AddressId   | int     |
| PersonId    | int     |
| City        | varchar |
| State       | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
AddressId is the primary key column for this table.

Write a SQL query for a report that provides the following 
information for each person in the Person table, regardless if there is an address for each of those people:

FirstName, LastName, City, State
SO HERE EVEN IF FIRSTNAME AND LASTNAME ARE PRESENT IN PERSON TABLE , THERE WILL NOT BE ANY INFO ON CITY AND STATE IN ADDRESS TABLE.
USING LEFT JOIN IT WILL MATCH THE DETAILS OF THE LEFT TABLE WITH THE RIGHT TABLE AND DISPLAY ALL THE INFO FROM THE LEFT TABLE AND MATCHING DETAILS FROM THE RIGHT TABLE INCASE OF NO MATCH OR NO INFO THEN PRINTS NULL
